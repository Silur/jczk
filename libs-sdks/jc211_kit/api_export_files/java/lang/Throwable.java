   * The Throwable class is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in the Java Card subset
   * of the Java language.
   * Only objects that are instances of this class (or of one of its
   * subclasses) are thrown by the Java Card Virtual Machine
   * or can be thrown by the Java <code>throw</code> statement.
   * Similarly, only this class or one of its subclasses
   * can be the argument type in a <code>catch</code> clause.
   * <p>This Java Card class's functionality is a strict subset of the definition in the 
   * <em>Java Platform Core API Specification</em>.<p>
