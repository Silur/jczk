/**
 * This interface represents a PIN. An implementation must maintain these internal values:
 * <ul>
 * <li>PIN value
 * <li>try limit, the maximum number of times an incorrect PIN can be
 *   presented before the PIN is blocked. When the PIN is blocked, it
 *   cannot be validated even on valid PIN presentation.
 * <li>max PIN size, the maximum length of PIN allowed
 * <li>try counter, the remaining number of times an incorrect PIN
 *   presentation is permitted before the <code>PIN</code> becomes blocked.
 * <li>validated flag, true if a valid PIN has been presented. This flag is
 *   reset on every card reset.
 * </ul>
 * This interface does not make any assumptions about where the data
 * for the PIN value comparison is stored.<p>
 *
 * An owner implementation of this interface must provide a way to initialize/update
 * the PIN value.The owner implementation of the interface must protect against attacks based
 * on program flow prediction. Even if a transaction is in progress, internal state
 * such as the try counter, the validated flag and the blocking state must not be
 * conditionally updated during PIN presentation.<p>
 *
 * A typical card global PIN usage will combine an instance of <code>OwnerPIN</code> class and a 
 * a Proxy PIN interface which implements both the <code>PIN</code> and the <code>Shareable</code> interfaces.
 * The <code>OwnerPIN</code> instance would be manipulated only by the owner who has update privilege.
 * All others would access the global PIN functionality via the proxy PIN interface.
 *
 * @see OwnerPIN
 * @see Shareable
