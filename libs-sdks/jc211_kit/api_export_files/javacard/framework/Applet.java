     * Only one Applet instance can be successfully registered from within this install.
     * The installation is considered successful when the call to <code>register()</code>
     * completes without an exception. The installation is deemed unsuccessful if the
     * <code>install</code> method does not call a
     * <code>register()</code> method, or if an exception is thrown from within
     * the <code>install</code> method prior to the call to a <code>register()</code>
     * method, or if every call to the <code>register()</code> method results in an exception.
     * If the installation is unsuccessful, the JCRE must perform all the necessary clean up
     * when it receives control.
     * Successful installation makes the applet instance capable of being selected via a
     * SELECT APDU command.<p>
     * Installation parameters are supplied in the byte array parameter and
     * must be in a format defined by the applet. 
     * The <code>bArray</code> object is a global array. If the applet
     * desires to preserve any of this data, it should copy
     * the data into its own object.
     * <p><code>bArray</code> is zeroed by the JCRE after the return from the
     * <code>install()</code> method.<p>
     * References to the <code>bArray</code> object 
     * cannot be stored in class variables or instance variables or array components.
     * See <em>Java Card Runtime Environment (JCRE) Specification</em>, section 6.2.2 for details.<p>

     * <code>Applet</code> class throws an <code>ISOException</code> with
