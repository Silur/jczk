<p style="text-align: justify;">IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>End of Agreement </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Relationship Between the Parties </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Open Source Software </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the specifications, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle specifications; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle specifications. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program/specification and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program/specification and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle specifications with a program licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle specifications or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entire Agreement<span><br /> </span>You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the specifications and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.</p>
